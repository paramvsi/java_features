# Java Features

All Java features to know for an intermediate developer

## Collections

- ArrayList - ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is a resizable array implementation of the List interface. It provides a way to store a dynamically-sized collection of elements.
- LinkedList - LinkedList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. It provides a way to store a sequence of elements with efficient insertion and removal at both ends.
- HashSet - HashSet is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the Set interface. It is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements and has no guaranteed order of its elements.
- TreeSet - TreeSet is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the NavigableSet interface. It is a collection that stores elements in a sorted order and does not allow duplicate elements.
- HashMap - HashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the Map interface. It stores key-value pairs and allows for fast retrieval based on the key. Allows null key and does not maintain insertion order.
- LinkedHashMap - LinkedHashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework and extends HashMap. It maintains the insertion order of its elements, which means it stores key-value pairs in the order they were added.
- TreeMap - TreeMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the NavigableMap interface. It stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the natural ordering of its keys or a custom Comparator provided at the time of creation.
